1. Basic Modules
    - PySide6.QtCore:
        + Feature:
            + powerful mechanism for seamless object communication called signals and slots
            + queryable and designable object properties
            + hierachical and queryable object trees
        + Using the module:
            + import PySide6.QtCore
        + Threading and ConCurrent Programming
            + QT provides thread support in the form of platform-independent threading classes,
            a thread-safe way of posting events, and signal-slot connections across threads.
            Multithreaded programming is also a useful paradigm for performing time-consuming
            operations without freezing the user interface of an application.
        + Inputs/Outputs and Resources:
            + Qt provides a resource system for organizing application files and assets, a set
              of containers, and classes for receiving input and printing output.
            + In addition, Qt Core provides a platform-independent mechanism for storing binary
              files in the application's executable.
        + List of Classes: 
    - PySide6.QtGui:
        + Detailed Description:
            + The QT Gui module provides classes for windowing system intergration, event handling, OpenGL, and OpenGL ES intergration,
              2D graphics, basic imaging, fonts, and texts.
            + For QT-user interface technology
            + If for dev, like Qt Quick
        + Application Windows:
            + The most application classes in Gt GUI are: QGuiApplication, and QWindow

            + QGuiApplication contains the main event loop, where all events from the window system and other sources are processed and dispatched.
            + It also handles the application's initialization and finalization

            + The QWindow class represents a window in the underlying windowing system. It provides a number of virtual functions to handle events (QEvent)
              from the windowing system, such as touch-input, exposure, focus, key strokes, and geometry changes.
